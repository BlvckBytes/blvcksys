# blvcksys

A collection of features bundled within a single spigot plugin, used as my personal playground.

## About

I just really need to work with Minecraft again, for nostalgic reasons, which is why I've created this "playground".
Here, I work on things like my own dependency injection, command abstractions, configurations and diverse features
that come to my mind. All for curiosity sake, don't take any of it seriously.
